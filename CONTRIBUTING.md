# Contributing to the Quantum Development Kit Samples #

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to the Quantum Development Kit!

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.
For more details on how to contribute to the samples or to the rest of the Quantum Development Kit, please see the [contribution guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/contributing/).

## Asking Questions

Have a question? Rather than opening an issue, please ask on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/q%23) or [Quantum Computing StackExchange](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/q%23) using the tag `q#`.

The active community will be eager to assist you.
Your well-worded question will serve as a resource to others searching for help.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in the Quantum Development Kit?
Have a feature request?
We want to hear about it!
Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Identify Where to Report

The Quantum Development Kit is distributed across multiple repositories. Try to file the issue against the correct repository.
Check the list [in the contribution guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/contributing/#where-do-contributions-go) if you aren't sure which repo is correct.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request.
Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

* Which sample or samples are affected

* Component versions
    - .NET Core SDK version
    - Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code extension version (if applicable)
    - Python version (if applicable)
    - Version of the `qsharp` package for Python (if applicable)
    - IQ# version as reported by `dotnet iqsharp --version` (if applicable)

* Your operating system

* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue

* What you expected to happen, versus what actually happened
